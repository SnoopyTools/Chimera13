  <h2 align="center">IT IS INCOMPLETE AND WILL NOT JAILBREAK YOUR DEVICE AS OF YET.</h3>
</center>

### Goals
The goal of the project is to build a complete jailbreak for iOS 13.0 and higher in Swift (though C and ObjC is fine where needed) while allowing people to contribute to the jailbreak as well as learn from it.

### Supported Devices
We wish to initially target A9-A11, though A12+ support may be possible (partial functionality should work on A12 until then).

### Current Status
* <i>Exploit: time_waste (due to GPL License, extract zip yourself to add)</i>
* Privilege Escalation (to root): Working (A9 - A13)
* Nonce Setter: Working (A9 - A13)
* Remount: In Progress
* Codesign Bypass: Update planned from Chimera12
* Code Injection: Update planned from Chimera12
* Injection Library: substitute or libhooker
* Bootstrap: Available from Chimera12
